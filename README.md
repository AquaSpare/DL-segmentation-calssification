Deep learning based image segmentation and classification

This repository contains the pytorch code used for a school project in deep learning

1. First problem is about classification of hand-written digits using a convolutional neural network on the MNIST dataset, several models are evaluated

2. Second problem is in semantic segmentation of biomedical images using a UNET model architecture
